					INCOMING! is a turn based, artillery shooter game developed within Unity, and coded in C#.
					It uses real time networking with custom made UDP / TCP protocols. In the game,
					Players are entered in a moving phase, where over a randomly generated 2D terrain,
					they are able to move how they would like. Then once both players are finished moving,
					They must then angle their barrel, and pick which type of ammunition they would like to use.
					They can then adjust the power and angle, and then fire! The game has destrutable
					terrain, and take inspiration from classic games like Worms or ShellShock Live.

					Unfortuneatly due to INCOMING! being produced on an out of date Unity engine, and the game not being properly upgraded
					along the way, it is not possible at this time to showcase the exciting gameplay that was created at this time. But
